            <p class="paragraph-about">
                Eid ul-Adha, also known as the "Festival of Sacrifice," is one of the most significant and sacred festivals celebrated by Muslims around the world. It commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son Ismail (Ishmael) as an act of obedience to God's command.
                <br><br>
                This year, in 2024, Eid ul-Adha falls on July 20th, according to the Gregorian calendar. The date is determined based on the Islamic lunar calendar and occurs on the 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the twelfth and final month of the Islamic lunar calendar.
                <br><br>
                Eid ul-Adha holds great spiritual and religious significance for Muslims, as it honors Prophet Ibrahim's unwavering faith and submission to the will of Allah (God). According to Islamic tradition, just as Ibrahim was about to sacrifice his son, Allah provided a ram as a substitute, demonstrating His mercy and provision.
                <br><br>
                The celebration of Eid ul-Adha begins with the special Eid prayer, known as Salat al-Eid, performed in congregation at mosques or designated prayer grounds. The prayer is preceded by a sermon, which reflects on the significance of Prophet Ibrahim's sacrifice and encourages Muslims to emulate his devotion and obedience to God.
                <br><br>
                Central to the observance of Eid ul-Adha is the ritual of Qurbani, or animal sacrifice, which commemorates Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son. Muslims who can afford it sacrifice animals such as sheep, goats, cows, or camels, following strict guidelines prescribed by Islamic law. The meat from the sacrificed animal is then distributed among family, friends, and those in need, emphasizing the principles of generosity, compassion, and sharing.
                <br><br>
                Eid ul-Adha is also a time for gathering with family and loved ones, sharing meals, and exchanging gifts. It's a time to strengthen bonds of kinship and community, as Muslims come together to celebrate their faith and express gratitude for Allah's blessings.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, Eid ul-Adha encourages acts of charity and compassion towards the less fortunate, reflecting the spirit of sacrifice and service inherent in Islam. Muslims are encouraged to donate to those in need, ensuring that everyone can partake in the joyous festivities of Eid.
                <br><br>
                Overall, Eid ul-Adha serves as a profound reminder of the importance of faith, sacrifice, and compassion in Islam. It's a time for reflection, gratitude, and generosity, as Muslims worldwide come together to honor the legacy of Prophet Ibrahim and reaffirm their commitment to serving Allah and humanity.
